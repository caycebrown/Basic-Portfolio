                    <p>Hello, my name is Cayce and I am a beginning web developer studying full-stack web development at the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp! 
                       One of my favorite things about web development is the design/UI side of it. 
                       Getting a chance to bring innovative and engaging web applications to life is something that I look forward too!
                       As a logic-lover and problem solver, programming and development for me is a rewarding activity. If you think so too,
                       then let me know, and lets make something cool together!
                    </p>

                    <p>When I'm not coding or researching development technologies you will find me outdoors.
                       Sunshine, laketime, and anything involving a hike is A+ life material for me.
                       I also enjoy just taking in the simple moments with my wife and daughter - who is already
                        growing at an alarming rate. Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
